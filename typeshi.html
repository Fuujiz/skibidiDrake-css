           Drake is hiding his snake today... I don't know why but according to my research, he became Skibidi Drake to pull up at the diddy party. I think he thought it was a costume, but now he's become one with Skibidi Toilet. He even made mini Skibidi Drakes! Hopefully someone can help me find the cure to this... we can't have Skibidi Drake roaming the streets, it's just not safe for everyone.
